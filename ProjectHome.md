## Use Cases ##

  * Contacts send a request SMS to your phone and receive your location back (once or periodically).

  * You can initiate and stop the location sending to one of your contact manually (before a long car trip for instance)

  * In case your phone is lost or stolen, you send your secret passphrase to your Android phone and the application will answer you with its location.

  * You can publish your location on Twitter using an integration with the Twidroid application
